							<h1>Junior Project</h1>
							<p>In DigiPen's Junior courses, I took GAM300 and GAM350 classes for a year game project.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>In the project, I was Audio Lead in six-member team who made "Royal Straight Flush" with Unity.</p>
							<div class="iframe-container">
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_h5aVQS8eM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</div>
							<br>
							<p>Since I was an Audio Lead, I contributed all audio parts. Furthermore, I contributed menu UI and game objects such as dropped card, portal, and level transition lobbies.</p>
							<hr>
							<b style="font-size: 2em;">Audio Parts</b>
							<p>There are broadly two types audio in the game. They are sound effects, and back ground musics.</p>
							<p>SFXs(sound effects) are achieved by <a href="https://getsoundly.com/">Soundly</a>. Since it has a chunk of SFXs, it is not difficulty to find appropriate sounds. However, the time when a SFX would play is challenging. //@@@TODO: do this!</p>
							<p>In perspective of team management, this is the first project I and all of my teammates used <a href="https://github.com/IDokan/GAM200Engine">Git</a> properly. I managed and resolved all of merges and conflicts that happened during projects. Furthermore, I forced my teammates to must do 'Check in Buddy'(shortly we called it CIB) and make sure write detailed commit description.</p> 
							<span class="image right"><image src="images/SophomoreProjects/GitKraken.PNG" alt="" style="float:right;"/></span>
							<p>CIB is letting teammates know what I had done and how I resolved bugs. The reason why I forced is I could review what I did and learn what others did. When I did it, I could get unexpected result. When someone is not able to finish their work (sick or emergent issues), buddy who know what he did could finish his work. Thus, I learned that CIB worked as one of the risk management methods.</p>
							<div style="clear:both"></div>
							<span class="image left"><image src="images/SophomoreProjects/commitDescription.png" /></span>
							
							<p>The other thing I forced is writing detailed commit description. I did not let teammates ignore commit description section. Sometimes we were under circumstances which we could not CIB. In the circumstance, others could know what I did. Not only this purpose, documenting my achievements is totally valid to do this.</p>
							<div style="clear:both"></div>
							<p>Finally, I would mention is team coding standards (breif version is <a href="images/SophomoreProjects/coding standards.txt">here</a>). I and my teammates discussed and made this standards to unity everyone's coding style. Furthermore, when a new teammate joined, we easily taught team's coding standard without using human resource.</p>
