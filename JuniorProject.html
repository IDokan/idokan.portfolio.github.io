							<h1>3D FPS Game<br>Used Engine: Unity<br>Team size: 6 people team<br>Role: Audio Lead, UI programmer<br>Duration: a year project</h1>
							<p>In the project, I was Audio Lead in six-member team who made "Royal Straight Flush" with Unity.</p>

							<br>
							<p>Since I was an Audio Lead, I contributed all audio parts. Furthermore, I contributed menu UI and game objects such as dropped card, portal, and level transition lobbies.</p>
							<hr>
							<b style="font-size: 2em;">Audio Parts</b>
							<p>There are broadly two types audio in the game. They are sound effects, and back ground musics.</p>
							<p>SFXs(sound effects) are achieved by <a href="https://getsoundly.com/">Soundly</a>. The procedure I put SFXs starts from talking with teammates. (Ask question -> find an appropriate audio -> get confirm) I asked them about what kind of audio do you expect to play?, when do you want to play?, If it is hard to define specifically, please let me know your feelings. The first, and the second questions are designed to get information I need. However, the last question is type of plan B. Teammates cannot tell me everything even they are a master of the project. Thus, I would get feelings what they would expect from the objects. Once I get the feelings, I could prepare better SFXs even they are not the one they requested. When I finish collecting information, it's time to find SFXs from <a href="https://getsoundly.com/">Soundly</a>. Since it has a chunk of SFXs, it is not difficulty to find appropriate sounds. However, the logic how SFXs play is challenging. For example, when you press a trigger of gun, a loud gunshot sounds occurs, and slowly disappeared. This type of SFXs are easy to implement. However, SFXs such as footsteps based on player's speed, and shield recovery sounds need relatively complex logic. Thus, it was good place to use my problem solving ability.</p>
							<p>In other hands, BGMs had slightly different problems. I used Garage Band as a composing tool. Since composing bgm had to start before level completed, I asked teammates about concept image of their level because leader of each levels are distinct. Generally there was no problems. I had to revise two out of five songs. The reason of a song was that the level manager changed his mind. Thus, there was easily fixed because he told me the way how to improve the song. However, the other song was a problem. The level that need new song was a desert level. When I heard of the level, I thought it would be African deserts. Meanwhile, the art director thoughts American deserts. The misunderstanding between them made the problem. I fixed it by replacing African instruments tracks. It reminded me of the importance of sufficient conceptual understanding and communication.</p>

							<b style="font-size: 2em;">Team Management Parts</b>
							<p>In perspective of team management, all teammates met periodically. Each others shared what they have done regularly. Then suddenly, a teammate disappeared. I and teammates tried to contact her online and offline, but she ignored us. The date of the milestone submission was slowly approaching. We had to do something. Since her primary role was an Art Director, the main consideration was to share her works without breaking art consistency. We added small changes to solve problems. For example, we added torch to enemy modeling to add variety, applied shaders to represent that a boss is invincible, and created plain particles to elaborate game feel. As a result, we produced Royal Straight Flush with absent of a teammate. At a showcase, we presented the game successfully and it does not look like incomplete. Furthermore, we received an unexpected level of response. It was sorrowful that the team member left the team before noticing her dangerous situation, but it was a successful project that mitigated the accident well.</p>
