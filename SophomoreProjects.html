							<h1>Sophomore Project</h1>
							<p>In DigiPen's Sophomore courses, I took GAM200 and GAM250 classes for one year game project.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>In Sophomore project, I was Graphics Programmer in five person team who made "Cheese Roll" with custom game engine.</p>

							<br>
							<p>This project is the most precious experience in the KMU becuase it gave me a deeper understanding of OpenGL and C++.</p>
							<p>I mainly implemented graphics interfaces to make other programmers draw image conveniently. Not only Graphics code, I also contributed on game's main mechanisms such as string between player, Camera movement, and Save point which is represented as refrigerator. Moreover, I implemented loading effect (we called melting cheese transition) and UI/UX in the game. Lastly, I was able to learn and apply a bunch of game programming pattern such as Message, and State design patterns.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>In perspective of team management, this is the first project I and all of my teammates used <a href="https://github.com/IDokan/GAM200Engine">Git</a> properly. I managed and resolved all of merges and conflicts that happened during projects. Furthermore, I forced my teammates to must do 'Check in Buddy'(shortly we called it CIB) and make sure write detailed commit description.</p> 
							<span class="image right"><image src="images/SophomoreProjects/GitKraken.PNG" alt="" style="float:right;"/></span>
							<p>CIB is letting teammates know what I had done and how I resolved bugs. The reason why I forced is I could review what I did and learn what others did. When I did it, I could get unexpected result. When someone is not able to finish their work (sick or emergent issues), buddy who know what he did could finish his work. Thus, I learned that CIB worked as one of the risk management methods.</p>
							<div style="clear:both"></div>
							<span class="image left"><image src="images/SophomoreProjects/commitDescription.png" /></span>
							
							<p>The other thing I forced is writing detailed commit description. I did not let teammates ignore commit description section. Sometimes we were under circumstances which we could not CIB. In the circumstance, others could know what I did. Not only this purpose, documenting my achievements is totally valid to do this.</p>
							<div style="clear:both"></div>
							<p>Finally, I would mention is team coding standards (breif version is <a href="images/SophomoreProjects/coding standards.txt">here</a>). I and my teammates discussed and made this standards to unity everyone's coding style. Furthermore, when a new teammate joined, we easily taught team's coding standard without using human resource.</p>
